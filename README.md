#GSDMM: Short text clustering (Rust)

This project implements the Gibbs sampling algorithm for a Dirichlet Mixture Model of [Yin and Wang 2014](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/058a/d0815ce350f0e7538e00868c762be78fe5ef.pdf) for the 
clustering of short text documents. 
Some advantages of this algorithm:
 - It requires only an upper bound `K` on the number of clusters
 - With good parameter selection, the model converges quickly
 - Space efficient and scalable
 
This is a fast and efficient GSDMM implementation in Rust. See [this project](https://github.com/rwalk/gsdmm) for a Python implementation.  

## The Movie Group Process
In their paper, the authors introduce a simple conceptual model for explaining the GSDMM called the Movie Group Process.

Imagine a professor is leading a film class. At the start of the class, the students
are randomly assigned to `K` tables. Before class begins, the students make lists of
their favorite films. The professor repeatedly reads the class role. Each time the student's name is called,
the student must select a new table satisfying one or both of the following conditions:

- The new table has more students than the current table.
- The new table has students with similar lists of favorite movies.

By following these steps consistently, we might expect that the students eventually arrive at an "optimal" table configuration.

## Usage
To use, first build the executable:
```shell
cargo build --release
```

See the help for usage information:
```shell
./target/release/gsdmm -h
```
